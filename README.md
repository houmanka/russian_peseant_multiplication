# RussianPeasantMultiplication

https://medium.com/@houmanka/russian-peasant-multiplication-with-elixir-part-1-77bfb2461a43 for part 1

This is still in building. Monad in `RussianPeasantMultiplication` hasn't been used properly

We should not wrap > unwrap monad, it is silly :) 
I will fix all of these as I am writting the next article

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `russian_peasant_multiplication` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:russian_peasant_multiplication, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
